# Discussion

My analysis of 5788 time-series in 1023 unique locations globally did not show an increase of turnover with an increase of accessibility. Contrary to my prediction, turnover was higher in less accessible sites, suggesting a rejection of my hypothesis of a positive relationship between turnover and increasing accessibility. The lack of positive responses/ negative relationship of turnover to accessibility could be due to the complexity of real-world biodiversity change, interactions between different effects of human impacts and uncaptured indirect effects of large-scale human impact; further enhanced by data and analysis limitations (high uncertainty of main effect at low accessibility). My modified second research questions revealed no directional relationship between human population density and turnover. The taxa-specific relationships between accessibility and turnover (modified research question 3) demonstrate that all studied taxa experienced turnover. My findings of negative responses to low accessibility highlight the complexity of real-world communities both in terms of heterogeneity of effect as well as heterogeneity of response. My study points out the importance for considering temporal dynamics and interactive effects of large-scale human activity when planning and implementing conservation schemes (refer back to possible reasons) and challenges the current focus of protecting wilderness areas as a primary conservation strategy.

## Complexity of real-world biodiversity changes in particular of temporal turnover
Although I did not detect an increase of turnover as accessibility increases, 63% of all time-series monitored showed some degree of temporal turnover. Even at low accessibility, turnover seemed to average of 25%. High accessibility should be treated with caution due to the little data availability of time-series with low accessibility scores. The high uncertainty around the main effect at lower values of accessibility, is due to that and will be explored further in the section of limitations. I demonstrated turnover across the whole spectrum of accessibility, that goes beyond a hypothetical baseline rate (Dornelas), emphasizing the importance of assessing temporal turnover for understanding local biodiversity changes.

Turnover (as compared to nestedness) is the dominant contributor to biodiversity change for the BioTime dataset (Dornelas). Species replacement can be broken down to local extinction and local immigration. On the other hand, exact same human activities have been shown to increase local diversity. Success of anthrophilic species (Aronsonn), increases in local diversity following disturbance and spread of exotic species. Especially through transportation and enhanced connectivity which is key to the metric of accessibility , alien species potential and thus immigration risk increases. Generally, human activities are assumed to increase rates of local extinction (Davies, 2006). Accessibility captures a range of human activities that have also been assumed to reduce rates of extinction. Accessibility can be seen as a metric capturing influences ranging from urbanisation, roads and transport network to land-use dominated by agriculture and pollution. Such human impact alters habitat and resource availability and increases habitat fragmentation. Evidence for losses mostly comes from space-for time subsitutions which have been critised for not accounting for ecological lags and community self-regualtion. Potentially either immigration or extinction rates are not for highly accessible places and might therefore not be reflected in the metric of turnover. Other study looking at forest loss has also found very varied reponses of turnover. This study also used Before-after-control-impact which could then attribute driver to change. However, there was no significant effect of magnitude of forest loss on turnover. This might indicate that a disturbance is a disturbance and changes in biodiversity can only be assessed in presence/ absence but not through magnitude. Therefore, either our current understanding of temporal turnover and its relation to environmental disturbnace is limited so far and more complex than thought and/ or there are inherent limitations in the methodology of temporal turnover. More difficult in my situation as accessibility is cumulative metric. I am accounting for both disturbance and recovery on top of the heterogenous effects of disturbance itself. However, it is true that it is difficult to match as most human activity has happened before first half of 20th century but most monitoring studies after. I guess I am capturing both recovery, disturbances, lags. 

## Interaction different effects
The coincidence between the presence of other drivers and/or their potential interaction with impacts captured in accessibility might explain higher turnover in less accessible sites. As explored above, the same impact can have different effects. But also relationships among interaction of different effects of accessibility can create heterogenous patterns. Trade-off between cumulative metric and understanding underlying patterns.
Multiple drivers may be associated with each other, either coincidentally (due to shared causes) or causally (when one driver affects the intensity of another) (Geary, Nimmo, Doherty, Ritchie, & Tulloch, 2019). Moreover, when drivers co‐occur, their impacts on communities may be additive, or interact synergistically (total impact stronger when together) or antagonistically (total impact weaker when together) (Cote, Darling, & Brown, 2016; Sirami et al., 2017). Nonetheless, few studies have examined the effects of multiple drivers on biodiversity (Mazor et al., 2018; Sirami et al., 2017). Hence, unpacking the spatial patterns of exposure of different drivers, and assessing the extent to which they jointly act on communities, is a key area of research.

On top of relationships among impacts associated with accessibility, other drivers also play important role. One very prominent is climate change; climate change second biggeset threat to biodiversity after land-use change? Ongoing research for interactions anthropogenic threat complexes. But research ahs shown how climate change can lead to turnover as well. Climate change displays geographic heterogenous patterns. Recent studies have created maps of global anthropogenic threats including climate change and other large scale human impacts, joining effects of multiple drivers. Less accessible sites might coincide with regions that are experiencing more extreme climate change, which can lead to biodiversity change (Isla paper?). 

## Indirect large-scale human impact
Both scale of disturbance and scale of monitoring plays a role. Ultimately
However, these findings might implicate that we do not understand temporal biodiversity dynamics at low human impact sides yet compared to better studied large scale human impacts. 
Other studies have focussed on more direct environmental changes (forest, land-use change) but I look at broader human impact (EXPLORED BEFORE). Studies with focus on low human impact areas, often titled wilderness, have found that such areas reduce extinciotn risk of species by 50%. Again, those studies were conducted with modelling approaches and did not use real-world temporal data. In order to put the most effective conservation measurements in place, we need to understand what is going on both in areas with low human impact and with high human impact using real-world data. 

Many landscapes are mosaics of habitats that have been subjected to both direct and indirect human influences. Farm fields or urban areas have experienced direct human influence where much plant and animal life have been destroyed and replaced with lower diversity land cover. While such areas can harbor populations of functionally important species (Wolters et al. 2000), the direct effects that people have on local biodiversity through habitat destruction or conversion are typically negative. In contrast, adjacent habitat fragments have not been destroyed, and represent areas where humans may increase species richness (e.g., species introductions) or decrease richness (e.g., fragmentation, pollution; see Haddad et al. 2015) and alter community composition (Wardle et al. 2011). Future efforts to quantify changes in local biodiversity must simultaneously account for the direct effects that people have on biodiversity through habitat destruction, or conversion, and the indirect effects (both positive and negative) humans have on remaining or recovering habitats. Only by simultaneously considering both the direct and indirect causes of biodiversity change on a landscape will we be able to provide accurate estimates of local biodiversity change.

Relation accessibility and wilderness?

Exploration accessibility as a metric to capture human impact
Cumulative vs single driver
Most places seem highly accessible, despite being often in protected areas -> challenges what we define as protected and to what scale
Proxy after all
It cannot capture direct impact and consequences of direct impact
human population density didne seem to have positive relationship with turnover either (but most places with quite low human population density) -> shows relevance of accessibility ( as it seems to matter somehow), but more interesting to see high accessibility and low human population density coinciding? -> is this metric better for capturing indirect impact than direct impact?

## Complex interactions of species vulnerability to environmental change (TAXA)
Biodiversity change is coupled to species vulnerability to disturbances. The vulnerability might differ depending on both the type of disturbance, which are a ranging because nature of accessibility; but also depending on characteristica of the species themselves. As turnover is affected by dispersal processes and metacommunity dynamics, species mobility plays an important role (Vellend, 2010), as does the degree of specialisation in the use of resources (niche width). These processes apply both within taxonomic groups and among. In general, for habitat loss and fragmentation caused by land-use changes more mobile species are better able to move among distant habitat fragments, than less mobile species. This would indicate higher initial temporal turnover, but then long-term might also allow more mobile species to persist.
Contrary research suggests that more mobile species, having larger home ranges rely on larger habitat patches and therefore might be more sensitive to habitat fragmentation. This would indicate more long-term turnover for mobile species.

Additionally, the impact at larger scale is more important for mobile organisms. Interactions between these two processes further play a role as with increased specialisation (narrow niche width) rely more on mobility to succeed than generalist species. 

Again, my results reflect the complexity of dynamics of the interaction between scales and vulnerabilities. (Due to problems with model convergence, I can only present results that evaluate the relationship between temporal turnover and taxa and not taxa’s different responses to turnover across levels of accessibility.) I presented taxa-specific relationships between temporal turnover and taxa (Figure 4), in particular showing that terrestrial invertebrates followed by mammals show higher temporal turnover than birds and plants (QUANTIFICATION). All taxa show some degree of temporal turnover (QUANTIFICATION). However, generally birds can be considered highly mobile and plants less mobile (reference HI paper), but that was not reflected in the amount of turnover experienced. 

Contradicting temporal lags with mammals and birds 
s we predicted, the period between peak forest loss and peak change in populations and biodiversity was longer for taxa with longer generation times (e.g., large mammals and birds, Fig. 5 and S14, Table S1). Population declines and increases occurred on similar timescales (Fig. S14). Losses in species richness lagged behind richness gains by only approximately half a year (slope = 0.5, CI = 0.1 – 1.05), indicating that extinction debts and immigration credits accumulated at roughly the same speed across taxa. 

## Limitations
Data availability and methodology
Taxonomic, spatial and temporal imbalances
results sensitivity analysis here?
spatial under/overrepresentation of sites modified by human activities? No points at low accessibility


Statistical analysis
The BioTime data compilation was not big enough (yet) to allow for an interaction effect between accessibility and human population density neither to include random slopes and intercepts for taxa as model convergence was not achieved. Talk about priors? 

## Direction for future studies
Interesting further studies include the interaction effects between different global drivers. More temporal studies in less accessible areas. Biotic homogenisation.
