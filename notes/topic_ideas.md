# Finding research passion

## Process
- what am I interested in
- what do I like to do and what am I good at?

- ontological assumptions
  - what is the nature of reality we are investigating?
  - how is it made up?
  - how do its part interact?

- epistemological assumptions
  - the sort of evidence that would count as an answer
  - how we are to find it

## Random thoughts
- evaluating policies
- challenge led research
- previous GEE papers
- check Space4SDGS doc
- what data sets are available in GEE?


##  What am I interested in:
- GEE
- social-economical connections with environment (one driving the other)
- global scale things
- indicators/ metrics
- sth "useful"
- learning
- tutorials
- machine learning
- multi disciplinarity
- positive deviance
- not looking in past but analysing sth for future?
- topic within environment/ecology?
  - check UN report USOOS
  - check Gregorius research
  - check previous GEE papers
  - check challenge led research
    - https://www.ukri.org/research/global-challenges-research-fund/
  - check dissertation Izzy approach
