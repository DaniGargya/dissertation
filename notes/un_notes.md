synergies GNSS and EO
While GNSS determines a precise position anytime, anywhere on the globe, EO provides
information on the Earth’s surface, its atmosphere and marine systems. As this study clearly
shows, the joint use of both systems unleashes an array of synergies that will have a substantial impact on sustainable development.

Best SDGS to track with synergie
Significant Contribution Tier SDGs (13 out of 17) are the SDGs that benefit most
from the use of EGNSS and Copernicus applications, including “Climate Action”,
“Sustainable Cities and Communities” and “Industry Innovation and Infrastructure”.

practical applications
For example, Copernicus is used to determine the components of air over cities which, when combined with precise
location data from GNSS, could identify the main polluting units and ensure better implementation of environmental policies. Copernicus supports also the determination of vertical displacements of land masses with sub-centimetre precision, while Galileo helps to precisely detect horizontal displacements; together they facilitate the monitoring of land
masses and help predict natural disasters produced by land motions, such as landslides. 

advantages space technology; contribute to achieve vs montoring progress
Space technology is one of several technologies
essential for successfully implementing the 2030 Agenda. It provides data, information
and services that directly or indirectly contribute to achieving the Sustainable Development
Goals (SDGs) or to assessing and monitoring progress towards achieving the Goals.
One main advantage is that space provides non-invasive tools, with capacity for
repeatable objective measurements, which will enable a more equitable and fair decisionmaking process. 

Uses EO - Copernicus (including Setninel) vs Landsat?
- agriculture, forestry, urban monitoring, ocean monitoring, air quality monitoring, renewable energies, natural disaster insurance, oil and gas

Renewable energies: this sector exploits EO data particularly for biomass and solar
energy. Commercial applications are relatively new for intermediate users. The
total EO market represents less than €23 million, of which Copernicus represents
10 per cent of revenue.

interesting examples
Case study 5. Improving food security through satellite technology
Accurate and timely information on agricultural production helps farming communities to make
informed decisions to achieve sustained growth in agriculture activity. This information plays an
important role in enabling early warning of harvest shortfalls, increasing crop production and ensuring agricultural sustainability.
An example of the use of EO data in agricultural monitoring is “remote sensing- based information and insurance for crops in emerging countries” (RIICE): a public-private partnership aiming to
reduce the vulnerability of smallholder rice farmers in low-income countries. The objective of this
programme is to make use of remote sensing technologies to map and observe rice growth in
selected areas. Sentinel-1A’s national-scale data are used in this project for monitoring rice crops in
seven countries.

Case study13. Copernicus enhances efficiency of solar forecasting
One of the main drawbacks of grid-connected solar farms is the intermittency of the energy produced. Difficulties with forecasting this kind of power generation have been used as an argument by
opponents of renewable energy for a long time.
Reuniwatt, a French SME, uses Copernicus to monitor the productivity of solar panels. Its main product is Soleka, which forecasts solar power production for electricity grid managers and photovoltaic
electricity producers, enabling them to determine the approximate amount of solar energy they will
have at their disposal at a given moment in time. Reuniwatt affirms that, thanks to Copernicus, it is
possible to improve the quality of forecasts by 30 per cent while reducing costs by up to 50 per
cent for one-day forecasts and up to 15 per cent for six-hour and 30-min forecasts, thanks to time
saved in data processing.

Case study 20. Satellites help to design more habitable cities
In cities, temperatures can be several degrees higher than in surrounding rural areas, especially at
night. Prolonged periods of high temperatures increase the demand for energy and water, trigger
health problems and increase air pollution and the greenhouse effect.
Copernicus medium and high-resolution multispectral satellites with thermal-infrared sensors provide information about thermal patterns, thereby helping to improve urban climate and weather
prediction models. An improved understanding of complex urban heat islands makes it possible to
develop more efficient alert systems, helping decision- and policy-makers to adopt effective mitigation strategies and improve urban planning.

Case study 22. Use of Copernicus for urban housing density analysis
Rapid urban population growth can hinder the execution of any well-thought-out urban plan. To
ensure the well-being and productivity of citizens, there is a need to set up the required infrastructure and services, such as water supply, housing and sanitation facilities. It is therefore crucial to have
a timely understanding of, and to monitor changes in, urban density, to help policy-makers react promptly to any sudden change in urban dynamics and make the best decision regarding the allocation of resources. This is especially true in developing countries, where urbanization is on the increase.
The Centre for Remote Sensing and Geographic Information Services (CERSGIS) used EO Sentinel-2 imagery to map the urban housing density in Accra (Ghana). By observing similar spectral
reflections exhibited by pixels in the images, they identified three urban density levels in built-up
areas: high, medium and low density.
