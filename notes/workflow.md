# Workflow

## Data selection/sources ### till 13th March
- update preregistration (write out model!)
- data inclusion criteria for BioTIME data set, merge data sets correctly
- standardize cell sizes of all datasets
  - partitioning BioTIME time-series? 
  - rarefaction BioTIME?
- extract/import mean accessiblity score from GEE matching the location of time-series with standardized cell size
- import population density data

## Data processing ### till 13th March
- transformations: grid cell, coding scheme categorical value population density for vis, bound accessiblity score between 0 and 1, same as HPD

## Data analysis ### till 13th March
- calculate turnover trends using Jaccard
  - temporal: comparing last year to first year
  - spatial: using same value as TT, but relating it across space?
  
- create model

## Writing ### till March 13th
- put general outline
- make conceptual diagram

## Sensitivity analysis ### till 20th March
- better temporally matched data
- sensitivity to cell sizes
- effect of latitude?
- number of studies that fall into protected areas

## Data visualisation ### till 20th March
- graph RQ TT
- PCA RQ ST
