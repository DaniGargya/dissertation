# Questions

### Data
- what is "plot"? STUDY_ID vs sample_desc
- check data inclusion/exclusion criteria
  - duration vs data points
- partitioning of studies?
- summarise all abundances from one year?
- calculate jaccard?
- dggridr?


### Preregistration
- wait for partitioning and then send


### General
- nestedness vs turnover?
- how to exclude other drivers?






- Measured variables: 
- Indices?
- statistical analysis
  - distribution of models?
    - difference beta distribution and priors?
    - beta ERROR distribution?
    - why distribution and funciton?



- how to convert arc-seconds into kmÂ² grid cells?

### Content

#### Title
- how to make it more catchy?

#### Frame
- what is the lead/what is the hook?

#### Research questions
- relate taxa back to temporal or spatial turnover?

#### Dataset
- how does the BioTIME dataset work??

#### Methods
- when/how to decide whether to compare jaccards to previous year (rolling basis) or comapred to first year?

- before working check for
  - nestedness?
  - scale sensitivity analysis?
  - range of accessibility scores overlies with location of surveys
  - distribution of model? -> zero one inflated beta distribution with logit link function
  - mobility score?

- data set pop density?
