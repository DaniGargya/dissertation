# Questions

### Preregistration
- RQ 3 taxa? what am I actually testing?
  - related to TT or ST?
  - prediciton RQ3 taxa: specify what I predict?

- criteria for my data?
  - duration vs data points
  - leep min time-series duration of 5 years? If yes, then only 2 taxa
  - report number of smaples or records?
  - sd super high, still report?




- Measured variables: 
  - metadata?
- Indices?
- statistical analysis
  - random effect: biome vs broad grid cell
  - study-ID? nestedness of data?
  - distribution of models?
    - difference beta distribution and priors?
    - beta ERROR distribution?
    - why distribution and funciton?
  - how to calculate spatial turnover?
  - RQ3: model and distribution?
  - what aditional analysis to include?
- transformations - what to include?
- partitioning of studies?
- rarefaction?


- how to convert arc-seconds into kmÂ² grid cells?

### Content

#### Title
- how to make it more catchy?

#### Frame
- what is the lead/what is the hook?

#### Research questions
- relate taxa back to temporal or spatial turnover?

#### Dataset
- how does the BioTIME dataset work??

#### Methods
- when/how to decide whether to compare jaccards to previous year (rolling basis) or comapred to first year?

- before working check for
  - nestedness?
  - scale sensitivity analysis?
  - range of accessibility scores overlies with location of surveys
  - distribution of model? -> zero one inflated beta distribution with logit link function
  - mobility score?

- data set pop density?
