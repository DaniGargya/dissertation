# Questions
- publication bias?
- check newbold references!
- interpretation random effects?
- AIC values?

- make list most important papers

- papers: check for
  - turnover
  - accessibility
  - roads/ urbanisation
  - hpd?
  
- importance of long-term monitoring (temporal)
- importance of turnover as a metric
- Before-after-control-imoact better than space for time
- accessibility leading to land-use change?

### model
- intercept is overall model slope/interval -> what does it mean if it is negaitve and overlap 0?
  - when plotting effect size of taxa -> add it in?

- interaction does not work, what does it mean to have two different models?
  - can I still visualise as I did it (group hpd anyways with ggpredict)?

- coi, phi, zoi plotting??
  
- where to put random effect?

- add_predicted_draws -> do I need to filter model before?  otherwise error: Error: The following variables are missing in 'data':
'scalehpd_25', 'duration_plot', 'TAXA'
  - substitute for ggpredict?
  
- general: super weird: super mostly very low hpd and very high accessibility? what to do with that?
  
# RQ1
- how to quantify effect into sth meaningful? relation to species?
- intepretation?

# RQ2
- predict taxa vs estimate of model output vs predict scaleacc and taxa?
  - how to get first category?
- interpretation?

# RQ3
- quantiles vs actual numbers?
- interpretation?
 
  
### Vis
- check all vis


### writing
- reframe accessibility? it's kind of a cumulative index for human influence
- how to cite paper gergana?
- what code to include?



- equation for model?
- sample size in methods?
- limitations of results?
- include sensitivity analysis conducted here?
