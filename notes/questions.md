# Questions

### Preregistration
- RQ 3 taxa? what am I actually testing? how do I get mobility in there? or part of discussion?
- Do I need to keep analysis for pop trends throughout whole document?
- leave latitude in?
- prediciton/hypotheses about latitude?
- prediciton RQ3 taxa: specify what I predict?
- how to convert arc-seconds into kmÂ² grid cells?
- criteria for my data?
- Measured variables: 
  - how to define Spatial turnover?
  - include interaction term A and taxa?
  - metadata?
- Indices?
- statistical analysis
  - random effect: biome vs broad grid cell
  - study-ID? nestedness of data?
  - distribution of models?
    - difference beta distribution and priors?
    - beta ERROR distribution?
    - why distribution and funciton?
  - how to calculate spatial turnover?
  - RQ3: model and distribution?
  - what aditional analysis to include?
  - include study reproducibility?
- transformations - what to include?
- state assumptions that road network has not changed much since 1990?

- what is the structure of BioTIME?? several observations in each study?
  - important for random effects as well
  - sample size?


### Content

#### Title
- how to make it more catchy?

#### Frame
- what is the lead/what is the hook?

#### Research questions
- relate taxa back to temporal or spatial turnover?

#### Dataset
- how does the BioTIME dataset work??

#### Methods
- when/how to decide whether to compare jaccards to previous year (rolling basis) or comapred to first year?

- before working check for
  - nestedness?
  - scale sensitivity analysis?
  - range of accessibility scores overlies with location of surveys
  - distribution of model? -> zero one inflated beta distribution with logit link function
  - mobility score?

- data set pop density?
