## Questions

### Content

#### Research questions
- combine temporal and spatial turnover?
- split by taxa?
- relate taxa back to temporal or spatial turnover?
- what about intermediate range of accessiblity?


#### Methods
- random effects
  - biome?
  
- null-models?
- before working check for
  - nestedness?
  - scale sensitivity analysis?
  - range of accessibility scores overlies with location of surveys
  - distribution of model? -> zero one inflated beta distribution with logit link function
  - mobility score?

- data set pop density?

- graphs
RQ1 - temporal turnover
  - with years? from 2005- 2015 or longer time frame? 
  - need for general trend?

RQ2 - spatial turnover
  - density graph??
  - or how else?

- include model predictions already?

- how to account for differences in taxa, biomes, geographic regions
- spatial, temporal, biological
- over what time period Jaccard trend (from each year or only one baseline) -> compare spatial- temporal?
- rarefaction?

### General
- how to order articles read/ notes taken

### Notes - not to forget
- accessiblity paper:
  - catalysing action to narrow gaps in opportunity by improving accessiblity for remote populations and/or reducing dispartities between populations with differing connectivity to cities
  - roads primary driver of accessiblity globally
  - assymetric distribution of cities and vast inequalities in infrastrucutral development
  - accessibility relative to gridded population datasets shows that 80.75 of the poeple reside within one hour of cities, but accessiblity is not equally distributed across the development spectrum.
  - look at cited lit about benefits low accessiblity
