# Questions
- quantify when writing resutls -> try out!

### model
- what does it mean to have two different models?
  - can I still visualise as I did it (group hpd anyways with ggpredict)?
  
- check logic of quantiles

- coi, phi, zoi plotting??
  
- intercept is taxa? but # the intercept is the predicted mean of the response when all other predictors have the value “0”

- where to put random effect?

- add_predicted_draws -> do I need to filter model before?  otherwise error: Error: The following variables are missing in 'data':
'scalehpd_25', 'duration_plot', 'TAXA'
 
  
### Vis
- check all vis


### writing
- reframe accessibility? it's kind of a cumulative index for human influence
- how to cite paper gergana?
- equation for model?
- sample size in methods?
- limitations of results?
- include sensitivity analysis conducted here?
