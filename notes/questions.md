## Questions

### Content

Title
  - will develop as I go - better specific or broad?

Intro
- frame:
  - BD vs Dev?
  - BD discussion declining/increasing incude; metrics and scales
  - BD theory about disturbance
    - link to accessiblity!
  - turnover vs homogenization
    
- key intro topics
  - now or later?
  
- key papers
  - how many?
  
- conservation efforts for what?
  - focus on which biomes and taxa?
  
- knowledge gap

Research questions
- homogenization vs community similarity vs beta diversity (spatial vs temporal/turnover)
- need for other metrics etc species richness or abundance (esspecially as part of temporal turnover)
- compare to alpha?


Methods
- seem to simple and straightforward and too broad, do I need to focus on sth more particular?
- random effects
- how to account for differences in taxa, biomes, geographic regions
- focus on one? focus on one taxa only?
- spatial, temporal, biological
- over what time period Jaccard trend (from each year or only one baseline) -> compare spatial- temporal?
- PCA?
- state space models?
- rarefaction?


### General
- how to order articles read/ notes taken
- readings to focus on
- paper assemblage talk about increase in beta diversity??
