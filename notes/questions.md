# Questions

- predict vs vis raw data
  - when what?
  - what to predict? can do several predicts?
  
- quantiles (hpd)
  - default ones are above 1?
  - how to set them?
  
- how to account for random effects of model?

- how to answer taxa question?
  - where to put in model?
  - slopes and intercept display?
  
- testing for overfitting?



### Model
- check syntax
  - what about phi?
  
- leave duration out?

- include area? (-> no relationship jacc ~ a; only when area logged)

- how to do sensitivity analysis with scale?
- other sensitivity analysis?

- how to get taxa?
  - do I need to standardise explanatory values?
  - how to access those values of random effect?

- how to check models?

- what about not being normally distributed?

- ggpredict: do I need to backtransform the values after?
- how to write for every 10% increase in accessibility, 10% increase of jaccard?


### Vis
- how to plot interaction effect hpd? at the moment use group
- RQ2: taxa -> what do density graphs actually tell me?
- can I use PCA?
- how to change axis?

### RQ
- change to hpd vs acc vs both?


### Data inclusion
- filter for has plot?
- one other study with many datapoints (exclude 502 as well? has 1451 studies)
- minimum duration vs data points as criteria

### scaling
- done right with centering duration and area?


### Accessibility/ HPD
- only normal distribution of loged
- fake data is better distributed?

### writing
- jaccard is increasing 15% for every 10% increase of acc?
- equation for model?
- sample size in methods?
- limitations of results?
- include sensitivity analysis conducted here?




### General
- how to exclude other drivers?


### Content

#### Title
- how to make it more catchy?

#### Frame
- what is the lead/what is the hook?
