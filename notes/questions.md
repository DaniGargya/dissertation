# Questions

### Jaccard
- how to go around that it does matrix for all of them together?
- numbers change if I have more than 1 plot?
- only uses absent/present?
- vegan package - use binary?

### Area/ unique lat/long
- for the studies < 1km² can I use the CENT_LAT/LONG data, assuming that all the plots were within the 1km² of the CENT_LAT/LONG given? That would also mean they would all have the same accessibility score.

- do I need to exclude the studies with area > 1km² which only have 1 CENT_LAT/LONG value and then do the sensitivity analysis with them later?

- unique(lat) gives out only 1023 different locations, what to do with the rest?

### Accessibility/ HPD
- what to do with NAs
- match long/lat, extract, then scale -> do I need to change order?
- only normal distribution of loged

## HPD
- does not show up when I plot it - why?
- different results wp and hpd
- many with 0

## Accessibility
- only log

### dggridr
- number of cells

### Data
- check data inclusion/exclusion criteria
  - duration vs data points
- partitioning of studies?
- calculate jaccard?
- dggridr?


### Preregistration
- wait for partitioning and then send


### General
- nestedness vs turnover?
- how to exclude other drivers?






- Measured variables: 
- Indices?
- statistical analysis
  - distribution of models?
    - difference beta distribution and priors?
    - beta ERROR distribution?
    - why distribution and funciton?



- how to convert arc-seconds into km² grid cells?

### Content

#### Title
- how to make it more catchy?

#### Frame
- what is the lead/what is the hook?

#### Research questions
- relate taxa back to temporal or spatial turnover?

#### Dataset
- how does the BioTIME dataset work??

#### Methods
- when/how to decide whether to compare jaccards to previous year (rolling basis) or comapred to first year?

- before working check for
  - nestedness?
  - scale sensitivity analysis?
  - range of accessibility scores overlies with location of surveys
  - distribution of model? -> zero one inflated beta distribution with logit link function
  - mobility score?

- data set pop density?
