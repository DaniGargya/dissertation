# Introduction

Globally, humans have modified 75% of terrestrial land cover, leading to major pressures on the biosphere and its inhabitants (IPBES, 2019). Increasing human population and the growth of cities and road networks, which predicate the equity agenda of the UN by advancing accessibility (UN, 2015), are expected to intensify impacts on the natural environment (IPBES, 2019). Large scale human activity has profoundly altered abundance, richness and composition of ecological assemblages in complex ways (Dornelas et al., 2014; Vellend et al., 2017; Hillebrand et al., 2018; Magurran et al., 2018). The consequences for ecosystem processes, such as their resilience are not fully understood (Vellend et al., 2017). Disentangling drivers of complex biodiversity change and establishing effective conservation practices without compromising human development is an urgent issue. Currently, we only have a limited quantitative understanding of how global change drivers, such as large-scale human activity, influence local patterns of biodiversity over time.

Importance link local and global BD
Human alterations to the environment have been widely viewed as a main contributor to the global-scale biodiversity crisis, with elevating rates of species extinction (REF 6th mass extinction?). However, studies reveal a more complex picture that is very dependent on the scales and biodiversity metrices used (McGill et al., 2015; Chase et al., 2019). While local alpha diversity seems to show no decrease in species richness, global biodiversity seems to decline (Butchart et al., 2010; Dornelas et al., 2014, ISla?). At the same time, local communities show high species turnover (changes in the composition of ecological communities), potentially indicating a different type of biodiversity change; large scale reorganization of communities leading to homogenization across space (Blowes et al., 2019). This homogeneity leads to a decrease in biodiversity over larger scales and has serious implications on the ability of species communities to adapt to future environmental changes (Eriksson and Hillebrand, 2019). Thus, it is very important to understand local biodiversity and its relations to global biodiversity changes to be able to predict how biodiversity will change on a global scale.

Importance temporal trends and real-world data; check gonazalez
Local biodiversity’s changes due to human activity are a topic of ongoing controversy. While some research reports a general negative trend of richness and population abundance following human impact such as land-use change, other studies reveal both increases and decreases at the local level. The controversy can be linked back to difference in methods used – the spatiotemporal design of the study. While former relies on space-for-time and modelling study designs, latter directly observes change over time with real-world data. Real world data heavily depends on long-term data availability, whereas space-for-time approaches have been criticised for missing out important temporal aspects such as ecological lags and community self-regulation. Given existing compilations of real-world biodiversity records, understanding real-world changes and the complexity of it is essential to advance our understanding.
How to capture human impact// Importance broader scale direct and indirect influences

Humans have driven biodiversity change mainly through habitat change, exploitation, pollution, climate change and invasive species. It is difficult to capture the difference aspects of human influences (and their interactions). Previous studies have focussed on individual types of environmental change such as forest loss and land-use changes/transitions. However, we know little about the effect of multiple types of human activities acting together and how they influence the reshuffling of ecological communities. The metric accessibility which is a measure of the closest travel time to the next urban centre can be seen as a proxy for multiple human influences. An increase in this metric goes along with increase of road network, urbanisation and human activities linked to urbanisation such as land-use changes and agricultural activity. Therefore, it can capture changes to the environment and its inhabitants such as habitat fragmentation, land-use change, alien species, habitat loss as a cumulative measure. For many of the human influences mentioned above, it can be hypothesized that effects are further enhanced/driven by local human population density.  
Importance to understand functional biodiversity and traits -> Taxa
Influence of humans have returned mixed results, with some studies reporting increases of biodiversity due to human influence, whilst other found strong declines (or general finding). Demonstrating a general pattern has been hindered by species-specific interaction between land-use change and biodiversity dynamics, as well as the influence of other drivers on biodiversity change. Other drivers include climate change etc. The interaction of taxa-specific can add to understanding overall and allows more specific targeting of conservation efforts. 

## Objectives and research questions
My aim is to quantify how global change drivers influence ecological communities over time. Specifically, I will focus on large-scale human activity captured in the metric accessibility to cities, and human population density on temporal changes in ecological community composition overall and across taxa. I will test if these drivers of global change explain heterogenous biodiversity change found across our planet. To achieve this, I investigate the influence of accessibility to cities on ecological assemblages worldwide and across taxa (birds, mammals, plants and invertebrates) by analysing change in 5787 time series, addressing the following questions:

1. Do sites with higher accessibility to cities experience more changes in assemblage composition over time (temporal turnover) than locations with lower accessibility?
  a.How does the duration of ecological monitoring influence the magnitude of detected temporal turnover trends?

2. How is temporal turnover influenced by an interaction between human population density and accessibility?

3. How does temporal turnover of ecological communities respond to levels of accessibility across taxa (birds, mammals, terrestrial invertebrates, terrestrial plants)?

## Research hypotheses
I hypothesize that there will be a positive relationship between higher accessibility to cities and greater temporal turnover. The magnitude of temporal turnover increases for sites which have been monitored over longer durations. The relationship between accessibility to cities and temporal turnover is steeper, when human population density is higher (all positive). When looking at individual taxa, I hypothesize that taxa will have different responses to high and low levels of accessibility, with both positive and negative relationships present. Those hypotheses will be tested against the null hypotheses of no relationship (or negative relationship) between level of accessibility and temporal turnover, and human population density and temporal turnover and taxa.

## Predictions

I predict greater temporal turnover with greater exposure of accessibility to cities, as an alteration of the natural environment benefits some species, while damaging others, influencing community composition. I predict greater temporal turnover in sites which have been monitored over longer durations, as the effect of turnover becomes more apparent over time. I predict the relationship between accessibility and temporal turnover to be steeper, when human population density is higher, as high HPD increases the pressures on the natural systems, leading to higher turnover.  I predict both positive and negative trends to be present among taxa, as they have differences in ecological requirements. 
If I find support for my null hypotheses, this will indicate that the metric accessibility to cities cannot capture the most relevant human impact on biodiversity, questioning the justification for humanly undisturbed places. If the results are in line with my alternative hypotheses, this will demonstrate the importance of humanly undisturbed places for the conservation of biodiversity.
