synergies GNSS and EO
While GNSS determines a precise position anytime, anywhere on the globe, EO provides
information on the Earth’s surface, its atmosphere and marine systems. As this study clearly
shows, the joint use of both systems unleashes an array of synergies that will have a substantial impact on sustainable development.

Best SDGS to track with synergie
Significant Contribution Tier SDGs (13 out of 17) are the SDGs that benefit most
from the use of EGNSS and Copernicus applications, including “Climate Action”,
“Sustainable Cities and Communities” and “Industry Innovation and Infrastructure”.

practical applications
For example, Copernicus is used to determine the components of air over cities which, when combined with precise
location data from GNSS, could identify the main polluting units and ensure better implementation of environmental policies. Copernicus supports also the determination of vertical displacements of land masses with sub-centimetre precision, while Galileo helps to precisely detect horizontal displacements; together they facilitate the monitoring of land
masses and help predict natural disasters produced by land motions, such as landslides. 

advantages space technology; contribute to achieve vs montoring progress
Space technology is one of several technologies
essential for successfully implementing the 2030 Agenda. It provides data, information
and services that directly or indirectly contribute to achieving the Sustainable Development
Goals (SDGs) or to assessing and monitoring progress towards achieving the Goals.
One main advantage is that space provides non-invasive tools, with capacity for
repeatable objective measurements, which will enable a more equitable and fair decisionmaking process. 

Uses EO - Copernicus (including Setninel) vs Landsat?
- agriculture, forestry, urban monitoring, ocean monitoring, air quality monitoring, renewable energies, natural disaster insurance, oil and gas

Renewable energies: this sector exploits EO data particularly for biomass and solar
energy. Commercial applications are relatively new for intermediate users. The
total EO market represents less than €23 million, of which Copernicus represents
10 per cent of revenue.
